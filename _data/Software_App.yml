- title: "Michigan Model for Diabetes (MMD)"
  content: MMD is a computerized disease model that enables the users to simulate the progression of diabetes over time, 
  its complications (retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy), and its major comorbidities (cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease), and death. 
  Transition probabilities can be a function of individual characteristics, current disease states or treatment status. 
  The model also estimates the medical costs of diabetes and its comorbidities, 
  as well as the quality of life related to the current health state of the subject.

- title: "Michigan Model for Diabetes â€“ Chronic Kidney Disease (MMD-CKD)"
  content: The MMD-CKD is a computerized disease model that enables the users to simulate the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with both type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. 
  The model outcomes include end-stage kidney disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, and death. Transition probabilities can be a function of individual characteristics, current disease states or treatment status. 
  The model also estimates the medical costs of diabetes and its comorbidities, as well as the quality of life related to the current health state of the subject.
